Vectorized Delay block for Modelica

In contrast to the Modelica Delay, the ClaRaDelay vectorizes in time, i.e. you
can specify a vector of previous times at which you want to know the values of a
variable and get a vector with the corresponding values as a result. This is not
only relevant for recurrent networks, but also for convolution integrals of
signals in transmission line models.

The model
[ClaRaDelay.Examples.ExampleClaRaDelay](ClaRaDelay\Examples\ExampleClaRaDelay.mo)
demonstrates the usage.
